## Quick Start

### 1. WLED Projects
Navigate to `projects/` to find or create WLED controller projects:
- **wled-controllers/**: Production-ready controller implementations
- **custom-builds/**: Modified WLED firmware with custom features
- **experimental/**: Testing new features and concepts

### 2. Hardware Development
All hardware-related files are in `hardware/`:
- Design schematics in `schematics/`
- PCB layouts in `pcb-designs/`
- Component lists in `bom/`
- Reference datasheets in `datasheets/`

### 3. Rainmaker Integration
See `integrations/rainmaker/` for the complete guide on integrating WLED with ESP RainMaker.

## Build System

This repository includes a sophisticated build system for easy multi-configuration development:

### Quick Build

```bash
# Build a project
./build-manager.sh build projects/wled-controllers/basic-esp32-controller

# Flash to device
./build-manager.sh flash projects/wled-controllers/basic-esp32-controller /dev/ttyUSB0

# Interactive mode
./build-manager.sh
```

### Features

- ✅ Multiple build configurations per project
- ✅ Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- ✅ One-command building and flashing
- ✅ Project templates for quick starts
- ✅ Centralized configuration management

See [BUILD_SYSTEM.md](BUILD_SYSTEM.md) for complete documentation.

See [PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md](PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md) for detailed comparison and selection guide.

## Getting Started

1. Review the documentation in `docs/guides/`
2. Check existing projects in `projects/` for examples
3. For Rainmaker integration, follow the dedicated guide in `integrations/rainmaker/`
4. Hardware designs can be found in `hardware/`

## Project Management

Each project should include:
- README.md with project description
- Source code or firmware files
- Configuration files
- Testing documentation
- Hardware requirements (if applicable)

## Contributing

When adding new projects:
1. Create a new directory in the appropriate `projects/` subdirectory
2. Include comprehensive README.md
3. Document hardware requirements
4. Add schematics to `hardware/` if custom PCB is involved
5. Update this main README if needed

## Notes

- Keep firmware libraries organized in `firmware/libraries/`
- Store all images and media in `resources/`
- Document troubleshooting steps in `docs/troubleshooting/`
